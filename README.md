Large language models (LLMs) are transforming natural language processing across various fields, including finance. However, one major hurdle for financial LLMs (FinLLMs) is obtaining high-quality financial data. Proprietary models like BloombergGPT benefit from exclusive data access, highlighting the need for an open-source alternative that democratizes access to Internet-scale financial data. This is where AlgoGPT comes in.

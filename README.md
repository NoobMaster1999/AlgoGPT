# AlgoGPT
AlgoGPT is an open-source LLM model train on Indian Derivate and Stock market data.

Large language models (LLMs) are transforming natural language processing across various fields, including finance. However, one major hurdle for financial LLMs (FinLLMs) is obtaining high-quality financial data. Proprietary models like BloombergGPT benefit from exclusive data access, highlighting the need for an open-source alternative that democratizes access to Internet-scale financial data. This is where AlgoGPT comes in.
